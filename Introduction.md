# Introduction/Buisness Problem

A resturant is to be opened in a borough of New York. For this problem Brooklyn, NY is selected. The neighbourhood in which the resturant should be opened is to be decided.The deciding factor in selection is the proximity to other popular resturants. **Foursquare** api is used to get the location data of the top venues in each neighbourhood. The neighbourhoods with least number of resturants are examined for deciding the final location. The locations with the least popular resturants will allow new establishments to grow without much competition. Also the borough will be divided into clusters based on K Mean Clustering.
